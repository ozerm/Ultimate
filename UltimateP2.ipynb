    "### In this research project we will be doing an hyptheses testing. The key measure of this study will be the number of active drivers in both cities Gotham and Metropolis. A/B test for practical results might be one of the best options here. A/B testing is usually used for user experience research. We will divide the sample into two halves randomly. The first half will be given toll free cards and the other half would not be given a such opportunuty. In this case the first group is considered as experimental group and the second would be test group. \n",
